### Examples
 - [A simple example](simple_example.md)
 - [Slightly more, with instances](instance_example.md)
 - Even more, with exception handling

Not that these examples:
- Were compiled using the [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) compiler version 1.8.0_171.
- Use public static variables to prevent certain compiler optimizations that obfuscate some points.
